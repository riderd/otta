# Create public otta groups table

Note that sometimes you'll get an error like this:

../otta_scripts/otta_contacts_to_public_otta_groups.rb:14:in `split': invalid byte sequence in UTF-8 (ArgumentError)

This means you have some unusual characters in the text file. If you view/open the OTTA_StudyName_OCAC.txt or contacts_20190829.txt file in less/vi, you can usually see them and remove/change.


# Copy the output from public_groups_table_data into the website

# Create members/contacts table
1. Open OTTA_Website/OTTA_Contacts...xlsx and save as tab-delimited file (call it contacts.txt)
2. Make it a UNIX file 
	% flip u contacts.txt
3. Edit contacts.txt and change funny characters to the English counterparts (Jos<92e> -> Jose). We should fix this
4. Process the data from the scripts dir and copy the output into the HTML table on the website
	% cd otta_scripts
	% grep -v "OTTA Study Acronym" ../contacts.txt | ./create_html_table_from_text.rb "OTTA Study Acronym,Primary Contact,Name,Email" otta-table | grep -v to_s
	
5. Update the data on the members/contacts page to match the spreadsheet date.

6. Delete ../contacts.txt
